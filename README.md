This thesis presents an HDL development methodology for composing hardware-accelerated kernels. These are specifically tailored for integration with operating systems for embedded systems.

At this time, interest on hardware implementation of system tasks is growing, as they have proved effective in many critical, resource-intensive and highly specialized scenarios, especially data centres.

Instead, the proposed methodology starts from distributed embedded system and systematic program design perspective. In addition, its employment was demonstrated through a case study that defines a simple general-purpose design.
This last comprises CPU-based processing nodes and an FPGA orchestrator. The latter and its modules are the interest object of the defined methodology.

Specifically, the modules which were implemented are a task scheduler and process control block, an IRQ controller and various kinds of mutexes and semaphores, specialized to applications.

Besides reducing the complexity of setting up an operative solution, one of the main results is also a remarkably low latency between commands sent by the nodes and the associated results processed by the orchestrator. This outcome is guaranteed by parallel algorithms and speculative computation techniques.
